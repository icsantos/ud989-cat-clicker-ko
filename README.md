Udacity [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989) Course Work

## Requirements I
- Use Knockout JS computed observables to add levels to cat clicker (based on number of clicks, e.g., 0 to 10 clicks = kitten level)
- Implement an array of nicknames for your cat and use a Knockout JS control flow structure to display them

## Requirements II
- Display multiple cats in a list
- When the user clicks on a cat in the list, display that cat and provide the same functionality for that cat as specified in **Requirements I**.
